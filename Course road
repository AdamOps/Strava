1. Get the code to run on Google App Engine
2. Create basic front-end
    - With streamlit?
    - Main objective is to have a customisable dashboard
    - Template version is fine. Tweaking will happen depending on features.
    - Basic feature should be to open runs on a map, see some basic stats of it, and have the ability to go back to Home
3. Figure out a way to store data, so that it doesn't have to be fetched anew every time.
    - Update feature like on PBViewer is good.
    - Local version with a CSV is working fine
        - Could probably just make a CSV based on the athlete name, and load that!
4. Let the user label the runs (easy/intervals/tempo/group run/race)
5. Add feature to correct micro-data
    - Huge list of coordinates; could easily adjust the element in the list, to fix outliers.
